# Iris

Toy webserver and a self-imposed code-golf project. Aims to replace instances of
`python.http` in my testing infrastructure, for easily serving a directory with
HTTP. Chances are _you_ don't need this.

You are discouraged from using this in production as Iris has not been audited
by a professional. However, if you find a security vulnerability or a piece of
code that affects speed or the memory consumption of the program, feel free to
create an issue on the issues tab.

## Features

- Very low memory footprint (< 2MB Mem usage)
- Small, minimal and self-contained
- Fast (Faster than `python.http`)
